# Assignments Classes and Objects
In these exercises the goal is to get familiar with classes, objects and case classes. You are free to either use 'regular' `*.scala` files or Scala Worksheets.

For the assignments, follow the instructions in the various files. The recommended order is:
  * [Point](Point.md)
  * [UnitConversion](UnitConversion.md)
  * [Time](Time.md)
  * [RationalNumbers](RationalNumbers.md)
