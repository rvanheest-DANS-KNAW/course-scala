    * 5 iterations can be found in [`inheritance/{IT1..IT5}`](inheritance/)
    * See also [this StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1991042/what-is-the-advantage-of-using-abstract-classes-instead-of-traits)
* Multiple inheritance
    * [a basic explanation](multiple_inheritance/animal.sc)
