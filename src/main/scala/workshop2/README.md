In this second workshop we will cover the following topics:
* [Abstract classes](abstract classes.sc) - *this is the inheritance pattern that you are familiar with from Java*
* Inheritance with traits and classes
    * 5 iterations can be found in [`inheritance/{IT1..IT5}`](inheritance/)
    * See also [this StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1991042/what-is-the-advantage-of-using-abstract-classes-instead-of-traits)
* Multiple inheritance
    * [a basic explanation](multiple_inheritance/animal.sc)
    * [a somewhat more advanced example](multiple_inheritance/list.sc)
