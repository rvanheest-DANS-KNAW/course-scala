`Option` and `flatMap`
======================

Consider the following classes and function (we leave out the implementations of the
methods for now). Here the methods `getBar` and `getBaz` can potentially return a `null` and
consequentially `compute` can return a `null` too. 

```scala
class Foo {
  def getBar: Bar = ???
}

class Bar {
  def getBaz: Baz = ???
}

class Baz {
  def getText: String = ???
}

def compute(foo: Foo): String = {
  val bar = foo.getBar
  if (bar != null) {
    val baz = bar.getBaz
    if (baz != null) {
      baz.getText
    }
    else null
  }
  else null
}
```

Just as before we can rewrite this such that `getBar` and `getBaz` return an `Option` instead.

```scala
class Foo {
  def getBar: Option[Bar] = ???
}

class Bar {
  def getBaz: Option[Baz] = ???
}

class Baz {
  def getText: String = ???
}
```

To use these new methods in `compute` we will first start by defining some helper functions for a better understanding of 
what is going on. First we define `computeBaz` which, given a `Baz`, returns the `String` from `getText`.

```scala
def computeBaz(baz: Baz): String = {
  baz.getText
}
```

Next, to compute the `String` from a `Bar`, we can use the `computeBaz` we just defined. However, the `Baz`
we need as input for this function is wrapped in an `Option` (see `Bar.getBaz`). We can use `map` on this 
`Option` and in that way get the `String` (also wrapped in an `Option`, of course).

```scala
def computeBar(bar: Bar): Option[String] = {
  bar.getBaz.map(baz => computeBaz(baz))
}
```

If we want to get the `String` from a `Foo`, we can try to apply the same trick as we did in `computeBar`. 
What we end up with, however, is not what we wanted: `Option[Option[String]`. Now we got two `Option`s nested 
before we have the `String`. Both `Option`s denote the fact that the value inside could potentially be a `null`.
Of course we can do with only one `Option` and therefore we can flatten the `Option[Option[String]]` 
into an `Option[String]` by using [`flatMap`] instead of `map`. This operator first maps a value inside an `Option` 
to another `Option` (this results in an `Option[Option[T]]`) and then flattens it to end up with an `Option[T]`.

[`flatMap`]: http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.Option@flatMap[B](f:A=>Option[B]):Option[B]

```scala
def computeFooWRONG(foo: Foo): Option[Option[String]] = {
  foo.getBar.map(bar => computeBar(bar))
}

def computeFoo(foo: Foo): Option[String] = {
  foo.getBar.flatMap(bar => computeBar(bar))
}
```

If we now substitute all the pieces together, we get a series of nested higher order functions. Verify for yourself 
that this is correct!

```scala
def compute(foo: Foo): Option[String] = {
  foo.getBar
    .flatMap(bar => bar.getBaz
      .map(baz => baz.getText))
}
```

This code becomes very hard to read quickly, especially with multiple flatMaps, as shown below!

```scala
def compute(fooOpt: Option[Foo]): Option[String] = {
  fooOpt
    .flatMap(foo => foo.getBar
      .flatMap(bar => bar.getBaz
        .map(baz => baz.getText)))
}
```

One way to make this a little more readable is to chain the operators rather than nest them. Note that with this 
you cannot access the `foo` or `bar` anymore inside the `.map(baz => ...)`. If you don't need them there, it is 
perfectly fine to chain rather than nest the operators.

```scala
def computeChained(fooOpt: Option[Foo]): Option[String] = {
  fooOpt
    .flatMap(foo => foo.getBar)
    .flatMap(bar => bar.getBaz)
    .map(baz => baz.getText)
}
```

A second (and definitely better) way to make this more readable is to rewrite the expression to a for-comprehension. 
In the code below, you read these lines as:

* `foo <- fooOpt`         "foo drawn from fooOpt"
* `bar <- foo.getBar`     "bar drawn from foo.getBar"
* etc.

```scala
def computeWithForComprehension(fooOpt: Option[Foo]): Option[String] = {
  for {
    foo <- fooOpt
    bar <- foo.getBar
    baz <- bar.getBaz
  } yield baz.getText
}
```

In all three implementations it holds that if `fooOpt` is `null`, the computation will terminate immediately by 
returning a `None` (`Option.empty`). The same holds when `bar` or `baz` is `null`: all following operations will 
be discarded (also known as '*lazy evaluation*') and a `None` will be returned.
