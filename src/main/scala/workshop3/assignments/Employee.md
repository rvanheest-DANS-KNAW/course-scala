Employee
========

1. In [Employee.sc](Employee.sc) an `Employee` can either be a `Developer` or a `Manager`. Implement the functions 
   that are declared, following the descriptions above each function.
2. Most likely the implementations of many of these functions look very much the same. Try to refactor as much as 
   possible. Hint: use higher-order functions for this and make sure they have meaningful names to make the code more readable.
