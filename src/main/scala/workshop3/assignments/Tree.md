Tree
====

Given is a `Tree` structure with some methods defined on it. Besides that, we provided a test suite. Make sure 
you implement the methods such that the tests will succeed! In all implementations, think carefully about what 
you need to return, which value(s) you have and what function types you have to get one type from another.

1. Implement `map` for both `Leaf` and `Branch`.
2. Implement `flatMap` for both `Leaf` and `Branch`. Think about how you would describe the behavior of this operator.
3. Implement `zipWith` for both `Leaf` and `Branch`. Note that you can only zip two `Tree`s together if they have 
   the same shape! Think about what you know about the shape of a `Tree` when you're implementing both 
   `Leaf.zipWith` and `Branch.zipWith`.
