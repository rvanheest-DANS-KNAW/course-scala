Workshop 4
==========

This workshop will be an introduction to the concepts of reactive programming and the RxJava/RxScala library. If you want to follow
along in your own project, please make sure to have the RxScala library on your classpath. See also the [RxScala README](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxScala#binaries).

Please read through the material in the following order. At the end of certain sections we indicate that you should be able to do
certain [assignments](assignments).

1. [Interactive collections](01%20Iterable.md) - *A brief looking back on the previous workshop and interactive collections*
2. [Reactive collections](02%20Observable.md) - *Introducing reactive programming, reactive collections and the basics of Rx*
3. [Operators](03%20Operators.md) - *An overview of some basic operators on `Observable`s*
4. [Combining streams](04%20Combining%20streams.md) - *An overview of some basic combinator operators on `Observable`s*
