Workshop 5 - Rx continued
- testing Observable
- Observable.defer
- hot vs cold Observable
    + Observable.just etc. are cold
    + Reactive source (mouse moves) is hot
    + implications for subscribing
        * no subscriptions
        * multiple subscriptions
    + multicasting (http://blog.danlew.net/2016/06/13/multicasting-in-rxjava/)
    + publish operator
    + ...
- Subject
    + both Observer and Observable
    + PublishSubject/BehaviorSubject/...
- Schedulers
    + computation/newThread/IO/...
    + JavaFxScheduler
- Clocks and time-based operators
    + Observable.interval
    + Observable.timer
    + drop with duration
- ...
- use cases
- sorting with time?
- mouse double click events (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YPX313eueDcTDApDHwb5Gm_X2EIorHJYLy29SRN1pRM/edit#slide=id.g1894345347_0_38)
